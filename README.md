# Diseases_Outbreak_Prediction
🩺 Prediction of Disease Outbreak using Machine Learning
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease using pre-trained machine learning models. It enables users to enter medical data and receive real-time disease risk predictions, assisting in early detection and proactive healthcare measures.
## 🚀 Features

✅ 1. Diabetes Prediction
**Predicts diabetes risk based on input parameters such as:
1) Pregnancies
2) Glucose Level
3) Blood Pressure
4) Skin Thickness
5) Insulin Level
6) BMI (Body Mass Index)
7) Diabetes Pedigree Function
8) Age

❤️ 2. Heart Disease Prediction
**Evaluates heart disease risk using:
1) Age, Sex, and Chest Pain Type
2) Resting Blood Pressure & Serum Cholesterol
3) Fasting Blood Sugar Levels
4) Resting Electrocardiographic Results
5) Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
6) Exercise-Induced Angina & ST Depression
7) Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
8) Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
9) Thalassemia Test Results

🧠 3. Parkinson’s Disease Prediction
** Analyzes voice-related features to detect Parkinson’s symptoms:
1) Fundamental Frequency (MDVP:Fo, MDVP:Fhi, MDVP:Flo)
2) Jitter and Shimmer Parameters
3) Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)
4) Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE)
5) Dynamical Complexity (DFA, Spread, D2, PPE)
