# Diseases_Outbreak_Prediction
🩺 Prediction of Disease Outbreak using Machine Learning
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease using pre-trained machine learning models. It enables users to enter medical data and receive real-time disease risk predictions, assisting in early detection and proactive healthcare measures.
## 🚀 Features

✅ 1. Diabetes Prediction
**Predicts diabetes risk based on input parameters such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
 - Age

❤️ 2. Heart Disease Prediction
**Evaluates heart disease risk using:
- Age, Sex, and Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure & Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar Levels
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina & ST Depression
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
9) Thalassemia Test Results

🧠 3. Parkinson’s Disease Prediction
** Analyzes voice-related features to detect Parkinson’s symptoms:
- Fundamental Frequency (MDVP:Fo, MDVP:Fhi, MDVP:Flo)
- Jitter and Shimmer Parameters
- Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)
- Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE)
5) Dynamical Complexity (DFA, Spread, D2, PPE)
## 🛠 Tech Stack
